title: Web Components.Tuesday

Web components are a collection of standards that change the way we build web applications. The web components contained four new constructs: templates, custom elements, shadow DOM and HTML imports. I think that the web components are really helpful because we can write shorter codes and keep them organized. For the new constructs, each of these can be used individually, we can combine them as well. By combining them we can create reusable and composable components. This is the most interested part to me because if we create reusable components, that means we could write less code… I think the web components would be useful because it make people’s life a lot easier, but I still need some time to figure it out how all these elements work…

HTML templates contains inert chunks of markup intended to be used later.
Almost all major web browser support html template.

Custom elements: let authors define their own elements, including new presentation and AP, that can be used in HTML documents

Shadow DOM gives us markup encapsulation, style boundaries, and exposes to web developers the same mechanics browsers vendors have been using to implement their internal UI

HTML imports provide a way to include a reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.
