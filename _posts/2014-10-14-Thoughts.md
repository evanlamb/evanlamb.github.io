<h2>Thoughts </h2>
  I think this is the best scrolling website I ever seen. This website have 8 sections, and each section contains text, image and videos. It’s also a responsive website so that people can see it not only on computers, but also tablets and phones.

  It’s very attractive that the creator use an infinite repeated video as the beginning of the website, I was stare at the like two minutes and want to see what’s going to happen next…then I found it was just a short clip video keep looping.
  
  I found that they did a very good on the balance of text and images/videos. I didn’t feel annoying to see the whole site, though it has lots text to read. I actually enjoy browsing the site because they did very good on the scrolly effects. When I scroll down to the image/video, the text will rise on the left or right side until I scroll down to the next image/video. The video will auto play once I scroll to that part, the sound will keep playing if I scroll down to the images until to the next section.
  
  I think it’s very fun to see this website because of the creative design and the scrolly effects they made.
