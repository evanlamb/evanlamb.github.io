title: Web Components Critique.Tuesday
---

I think web components is like giving a new hope for web designers, because building a web applications is more complicated than it used to be in nowadays, but web components gives a new way for designer to make their life easier. Although not every web browser support web components for now, but I believe maybe after several updates most of the major web browser will support. That’s very excited that the web components making it possible to create rich Web UIs using ordinary CSS and markup. I really like the new HTML element Template, because once it’s in the DOM, you can activate a template as many times as you want to make as many visible copies as you need. I think the web components would the future of web application development. Of course some newer technologies might come out and better than the web components, but for now, it’s a better choice for us.
