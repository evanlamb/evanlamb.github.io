<h2> SMACC </h2>

  I feel like I have a more deep understand of the CSS after reading these articles. It really helps me to improve my CSS architecture skills. The articles are very specific and noted what needs to be careful while writing CSS.
The base rules are just very basic notes about the CSS structure. I have no problem with that, the CSS resets is little new to me though. The other rules let me know how to make the CSS more organized. I think they are very helpful.
