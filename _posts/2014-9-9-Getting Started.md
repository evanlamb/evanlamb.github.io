<h2> Why I'm here </h2>
  The reason why I am interested in web development is because I think that web development is a very important part of the society in nowadays. No one can deny the power of Internet in business, social interaction or in many ways. There are so many cases show that many business became successful because of they have a good website to provide their services. I think that googol is a good example because what they first did was a search engine. They have a successful web design; there were no ads or any other distracting materials on their website so that the user can focus on what they need from this company – search.  

  I also work as a part time graphic designer, some of my clients asks me if I can do web design for them too, but I don’t have sort of knowledge to build a website. This is the second reason why I want to learn more about web development. I think that would be so much helpful for my jobs in the future.
