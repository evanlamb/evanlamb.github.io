title: CSS Pre-Processor.Tuesday

<h2> Responsive Images </h2>
  I didn’t have any idea of what’s CSS pre-processors before I taken the last class. I feel like the CSS pre-processors are very helpful and make things a lot easier. I really like the mixins and nesting part, because I no longer need to write much more codes and they make the codes a lot easier to read. 
I would like to use them in my after works, because I ‘d like to learn new things especially it will make my life easier . However, I need more practices to do it well, because the form is little different than the original CSS. But I like how they organized the codes, I think I’m going love it.
