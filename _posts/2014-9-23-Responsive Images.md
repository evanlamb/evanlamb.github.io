<h2>Responsive Images</2>
I think that the responsive images is important in nowadays. 
Because responsive web design is popular because more and more people using their smartphones to browse websites. 
If a company really wants to promote their products, they donâ€™t want to only build a traditional website, but also a responsive website. 
Because nobody wants to browse a regular website on a small phone screen. 
In a responsive website, every layout would be different from the regular, but we still wants to keep the images to make the web look a little more attractive and interesting. 
As a result, we have to make the images responsive too, because no one wants to see a squeezed image. 
I think that the difficult part is how to make the image fit for different size screens without losing proportion and quality.
